\nsection{Personal profile}
  \label{sec:persprof}

  Currently, I am a Postdoc in the Bioinformatics group at the KNAW/Westerdijk Institute of Fungal Biodiversity (formerly CBS).
  Having been raised in Norway, among people from all over the world, I am accustomed to an international, multicultural environment.
  Academically, machine learning techniques are interesting to me, and bioinformatics presents a splendid opportunity to develop and apply them.
  I am looking for a position where challenging problems, involving many different skills and team work, allow me to contribute positively to society, and further develop my skills.
